# ATSAML10 Serial Bootloader

This is a serial bootloader for [Microchip (née Atmel) ATSAML11 microcontrollers](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/microcontrollers-and-microprocessors/32-bit-mcus/sam-32-bit-mcus/sam-l/sam-l10-l11). It is an updated version of [Microhip's bootloader implementation](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/application-notes/an2699).

- Uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.
- Self hosted, doesn't require abandoned Atmel IDE.

## Bootloader Usage

### Entering the bootloader

The bootloader will be entered when either of the following conditions are met:

- There is no application uploaded
- The BOOT button is pressed at reset

The LED will flash at ~5 Hz to indicate it is in the bootloader.

### Using the bootloader

> [!NOTE]
> The steps below are for Linux/macOS, I do not have a Windows machine to test this at the moment.

### Setting up the environment

The uploader is `./tools/boot.py`. A virtual environment should be set up before first use. In `./tools/` run:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> This assumes you are using `bash` or `zsh`. For `fish` and `tcsh` append `.fish` and `.csh` respectively to `source venv/bin/activate`.

### Uploading your code

Before you start, activate the virtual environment. In `./tools/` run:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now, you can upload your firmware to the microcontroller. In `./tools/` run:

```shell
python3 boot.py -v -i SERIAL_PORT -f PATH_TO_BIN -o 0x400
python3 boot.py -v -i SERIAL_PORT -r
```

This first loads the firmware and then resets the device. If the BOOT pin is not pulled LOW, the SAML10 will enter the application.

If you need to list your available `SERIAL_PORT`s, simply run `python3 boot.py`.

### Troubleshooting

- Is the bootloader responsive?
  - Open the serial device in a terminal. 115200 baud, 8+1 bits, no parity.
  - Type any key. The bootloader should return `Q` in return.
- Check the Python version you are using, it must be Python 3.
- Is the virtual environment activated?

## Building the bootloader

### Altering

You need to alter the pin configuration to match your board's bootloader entry pin and optionally LED indication and regulator enable. This can be done by setting the following `#define`s in `src/saml_bl.c`:

- `BL_REQ_PIN`: pin for bootloader entry button/jumper.
- `BL_LED_PIN`: pin for LED (active high or low).
- `BL_REG_PIN`: pin for regulator enable.

The following `#define`s select the LED and regulator enable functionality:

- `BL_LED_EN`: set to `1` to enable LED indication, `0` to disable.
- `BL_REG_EN`: set to `1` to enable regulator enable, `0` to disable.
- `BL_REG_HIGH`: set to `1` for active HIGH regulator enable, `0` for active LOW.

### Building

To build the bootloader, you need the [Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads) installed. With this on your path, simply run:

> make

This will produce `build/saml10_bl.bin` which you can upload to the microcontroller as described above.
